## Pipeline Springboard

The Pipeline Springboard project is designed to help you automatically run your pipelines quickly, with very little effort. Our philosophy is that you should focus more on your code, and less on your build and deployments.

This project is still in the build phase, so please be patient as we build out each pipeline!Once ready, each pipeline will be linked here.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
